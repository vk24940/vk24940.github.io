description:  Drop Point Detection System from Aerial Imagery â€” As part of Project MANAS, the official AI and Robotics Team of MIT Manipal comprising 25 interdisciplinary undergraduate students specializing in autonomous systems, I contributed to the design and implementation of a computer vision pipeline for identifying optimal drop points from drone-captured images in an autonomous aerial delivery platform. The project achieved a boost in YOLO-based object detection accuracy from 76% to 94% through the application of advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model fine-tuning techniques. Custom annotation workflows were developed alongside embedded inference optimization, with performance validated in both simulated environments and real-flight tests, resulting in a significant improvement in mission success rates during competitive robotics challenges.
