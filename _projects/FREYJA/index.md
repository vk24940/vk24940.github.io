description:  Drop Point Detection System from Aerial Imagery â€” Designed and implemented a computer vision pipeline for detecting optimal drop points from drone-captured images as part of an autonomous aerial delivery system. Enhanced YOLO-based object detection accuracy from 76% to 94% by integrating advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model fine-tuning strategies. Developed custom annotation workflows, optimized inference for embedded deployment, and validated performance in both simulated and real-flight conditions, significantly improving mission success rates in competitive robotics scenarios.
