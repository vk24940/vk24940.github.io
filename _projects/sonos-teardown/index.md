title: Research Internship - IIT Bombay
description: During my research internship at IIT Bombay under the mentorship of Prof. Pramod Dsa in the Electrical and Electronics Department, I worked on the implementation and optimization of control for a SPIM using a Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D microcontroller in conjunction with a SEMIKRON inverter stack. The project focused on achieving precise speed regulation through V/f control, with real-time parameter tuning enabled via Code Composer Studio for improved flexibility and experimental refinement. In parallel, finite element analysis (FEA) simulations were conducted using Siemens MAGNET and ANSYS to evaluate the motorâ€™s electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical characteristics. Insights from these simulations were applied to optimize motor parameters, resulting in improved efficiency, enhanced torque output, and better operational reliability.
