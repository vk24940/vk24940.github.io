title: Hybrid Control System for Batch Reactor (Minor Specialization in Control Systems)
description:  As part of my Control Systems minor specialization under the mentorship of Dr. I.T. Arasu, I am currently working on the design and implementation of a hybrid control strategy for a nonlinear batch reactor, combining Non Linear Model Predictive Control with Reinforcement Learning to improve process efficiency, stability, and robustness under uncertainty. NMPC was employed for constraint handling and predictive optimization, while RL enhanced adaptability to process variations and unmodeled dynamics.
skills: 
  - Control Strategies - Model Predictive Control, Reinforcement Learning, nonlinear process control
  - Simulation & Modeling - MATLAB/Simulink, custom Gym environment
  - Optimization - Constraint handling, adaptive control tuning
  - Programming Languages - MATLAB, Python
