title: Quadruped Robotic Platform (Personal Project)
description:  Designed and developed a quadruped robotic platform aimed at exploring legged locomotion and autonomous navigation. The system is built around a Raspberry Pi 4B for onboard processing, with a custom mechanical structure fabricated using 3D-printed components. The design integrates an AI-based navigation system for autonomous operation, including obstacle detection and path planning. A custom PCB is currently under development to centralize power distribution and signal routing, improving system reliability, maintainability, and wiring efficiency. Mechanical and control designs were iteratively refined based on simulation and prototype testing to enhance gait stability and energy efficiency.
