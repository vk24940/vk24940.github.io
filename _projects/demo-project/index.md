description:  Autonomous Ground Vehicle â€“ Navigation & Perception System - As part of Project MANAS, a 25-member interdisciplinary undergraduate student team at MIT Manipal specializing in AI and robotics for autonomous systems, I contributed to the development of an integrated navigation and perception pipeline for an autonomous ground vehicle. The system incorporated real-time goal generation and path planning capabilities to ensure robust operation in dynamic environments. Goal generation algorithms were designed to adapt to mission objectives and environmental constraints, while real-time path planning was implemented to enable collision-free navigation. System performance was validated through simulation and on-vehicle trials, resulting in measurable improvements in obstacle avoidance efficiency and overall mission success rates.
