description:  Autonomous Ground Vehicle – Navigation & Perception System - As part of Project MANAS, a 25-member interdisciplinary undergraduate student team at MIT Manipal specializing in AI and robotics for autonomous systems, developed an integrated navigation and perception pipeline for an autonomous ground vehicle. Combined real-time goal generation, path planning, and human identification capabilities to enable robust operation in dynamic environments. Implemented YOLO-based person detection and Siamese network–driven face recognition using dashcam footage for target tracking. Designed and tested goal generation algorithms responsive to mission objectives and environmental constraints, and implemented real-time path planning for collision-free navigation. Validated system performance through simulation and on-vehicle trials, achieving improved obstacle avoidance efficiency and mission success rates.
