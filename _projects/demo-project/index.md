description:  Autonomous Ground Vehicle – Navigation & Perception System
Developed an integrated navigation and perception pipeline for an autonomous ground vehicle, combining real-time lane detection, goal generation, path planning, and human identification capabilities. Implemented YOLO-based person detection and custom Siamese network–driven face recognition using dashcam footage to enable target tracking in dynamic environments. Designed and tested goal generation algorithms that adapt to mission objectives and environmental constraints, and implemented real-time path planning for collision-free navigation. Validated the system through simulation and on-vehicle trials, achieving improved obstacle avoidance efficiency and mission completion rates.
